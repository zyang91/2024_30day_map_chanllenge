## CPLN 5030 Mini Project2
As stated above you will turn in 5 maps as your primary deliverables. Of those 5 you are required to have three maps for the first 3 days/themes: points, lines and polygons. The other 2 maps you are free to do with as you please. You can make use of any of the days. To repeat:

Deliverables:

**5 maps**

- 1 map for points
- 1 map for lines
- 1 map for polygons
- 2 maps of your choice

In addition to the maps you must write out your approach to the map. At minimum, you need to report your data sources used, the software you used (R, ArcPro, Illustrator etc), the broad steps you took/techniques you used, and what, if any, maps served as inspiration.
